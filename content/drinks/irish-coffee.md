This approach uses [burnt sugar syrup](/ingredients/burnt-sugar-syrup) instead of granulated sugar, so I take pains to warm it and the whiskey before mixing with the coffee to avoid a lukewarm drink.

Technically, any Irish whiskey will work, but you really ought to use Tullamore Dew.

{{< ingredients
  "1 oz Irish whiskey"
  "¾ oz burnt sugar syrup"
  "3½ oz extra strong fresh-brewed coffee"
  "1 oz cream, whipped until thick and frothy but still pourable"
>}}

{{< instructions >}}
Brew your coffee with the normal amount of grounds but half the normal amount of water so it is extra strong.

Pour hot water into the mug to pre-warm it, and into a small bowl. Add whiskey and burnt sugar syrup to a metal cocktail shaker. Place the shaker in the bowl to warm the whiskey and syrup. Do this while your coffee brews so it can sit for a couple minutes.

Pour out the hot water from the mug. Add the whiskey-syrup mixture and about 3½ oz coffee. The coffee will float atop the syrup, so give it a good stir. Then, holding a spoon just above the coffee, pour the frothed cream over the spoon so it floats atop the drink. Enjoy it while hot!
