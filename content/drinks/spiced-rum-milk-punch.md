This is typically done as a cold drink, but I’ve found it truly shines when the milk is warmed and frothed instead.

{{< ingredients
  "1½ oz spiced rum"
  "¾ oz simple syrup"
  "3 oz whole milk"
  "dash vanilla extract"
  "nutmeg & cinnamon for garnish"

**Cold**: Shake all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice. Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.

**Hot**: Put the rum, syrup, and vanilla in a metal shaker and heat it gently by placing the shaker in a bowl of hot water. Preheat a small mug with hot water. Meanwhile, heat the milk and froth it with a mixer or milk frother. Empty the mug and add the rum mixture; pour the hot milk into the rum and stir gently to combine.

Garnish with ground nutmeg and cinnamon.
