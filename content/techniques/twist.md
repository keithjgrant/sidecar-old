A twist is a piece of peel from citrus that is added to a cocktail as a garnish. This isn’t just about making the drink look pretty, however: the oils in the peel are an important part of the drink’s flavor.

To make a twist, you can use a Y-shaped vegetable peeler to cut off a strip of peel. Or, you can use a knife and cut it off, taking care to not include too much of the pith (the white part beneath the peel).

Once the rest of the cocktail is constructed, hold the twist over the drink and give it give it a bend or twist to express a fine spray of oils onto the drink. It may not seem like much, but these oils stay on top of the drink and provide a lot of fragrance.

Finally, run the peel around the edge of the glass, then place it the drink.

## Discarding
Some recipes call for a twist “discarded”, it means you should express the oils from the twist over the drink as usual, but don’t add the peel itself to the drink.
